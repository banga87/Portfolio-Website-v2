                <p>
                  Over the past decade I've had a successful career in the tech industry. I've worked for small companies, large companies, have played the role of individual contributor in sales teams and managed the operations and processes as Chief Operating Officer. I've grown teams, hired people, closed deals and even founded a successful HubSpot CRM Implementation agency.<br><br>

                  Despite the success I've had an itch that needed scratching. That itch being to get under the hood of the software I was selling and figure out how it all works and build some for myself. I've always admired the work of the Software Engineer. To those who aren't us, it seems like a black box where magic happens that can't be explained. I want to be a magician.<br><br>

                  I've since devoted a good portion of the last 12 months teaching myself how to code. I've learnt coding concepts such as OOP, data structures and algorithms as well as a range of languages such as Python and JavaScript. I've loved every minute of it.<br>

            </div>
              <p>
                As someone with years of business experience I bring a unique perspective to the software engineering role. I have a deep understanding of business operations, team dynamics and customer relations. I know what makes a team tick and achieve great things. I know how to listen to customers and ensure they have a great experience with the company. I'm a great problem solver and capabale of thinking big picture while still paying attention to the little things.<br><br>

                This experience is something you won't find in any other Junior Engineer fresh out of University or off the back of an internship.<br><br>

                I'm also not afraid of hard work. I believe that nothing comes easy. Anything we truly want in life will take some measure of sacrifice, discipline and a healthy level of obsession to achieve.

                I am proficient in a range of current languages and technologies, including but not limited to the below:
