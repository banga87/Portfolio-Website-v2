                <p>
                  Enthusiastic and accomplished professional transitioning into Software Development after a 
                  successful career in Sales, Operations, and Entrepreneurship in Tech and SaaS companies. 
                  Equipped with a solid understanding of business operations, project management, and team 
                  leadership, I am eager to bring these skills into a development role. A self-taught coder, 
                  I am looking to integrate my professional experience with my newly acquired skills in HTML, 
                  CSS, JavaScript, React, Python, Django, and PostgreSQL to contribute to an innovative software 
                  development team.

            </div>
              <p>
                With over a decade of professional experience in Sales, Sales Management, Operations, and leading
                my own tech startup, I offer a unique perspective to the developer role. My deep understanding
                of business operations, team dynamics, and the software development life cycle, combined with
                my technical skills, allows me to approach problem-solving from a comprehensive perspective.
                I'm well-equipped to understand client needs, work effectively in team environments, and
                contribute to strategic planning.
